# Hello !!
Welcome to my mini game called the SunnyLand..in this game you have to help foxy to collect all the gems!!
my project controls are the left and right arrows to walk right and left and to jumb you can use space .
my game is a platformer game so my mechanics are around the player to collect gems whithout falling 
How did you approach the design of the game ?
As a game developer, I was inspired more about platform games like old games as super mairo because I see there is alot of creativity and adventure 
in this game desgin 
What challenges did you face while implementing the gameplay mechanics?
one of the chanllenges is to make the scoring system and how to show it to User
How would you improve your game if you had more time?
I think of adding losing conditions like if the player fall of the ground of get hit by the enemy 
Can you explain any design patterns or principles you used in your code?
 Single Responsibility Principle (loosely): The Player class handles movement, jumping, animation, 
 collision detection (partially), and scorekeeping (partially). While it does multiple things, 
 it's arguably cohesive for a player object.
